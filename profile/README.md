## OSU Polaris
Polaris is a partnership between undergraduate and graduate physics and astronomy students at The Ohio State University dedicated to fostering a more welcoming and community oriented undergraduate physics experience in the OSU Departments of Physics and Astronomy. We are a student-run organization developed in collaboration between graduates and undergraduates.

Our focus lies in the augmented retention of non-traditional groups and students who have had less access to physics and astronomy by providing professional and academic mentorship for those groups. We seek to aid undergraduate students in creating and maintaining a supportive learning community. 

For more information about our organization, structure, and initiatives, please see [our website](https://u.osu.edu/polaris/).
